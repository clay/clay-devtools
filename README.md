Slip
====

*slip (n): A slip is a liquid mixture or slurry of clay and/or other materials suspended in water used in making pottery*

Slip is a Chrome extension for exploring [Clay](https://github.com/clay) pages

- adds an info window to the bottom right corner of the page for easy page/layout/component discovery
- adds debugging borders to components
- shift+click opens the (unresolved) instance data in a new tab
- alt+click opens the resolved component instance data in a new tab
- clicking a component highlights it

## In Progress: Vim-like keystroke functionality
Currently...
- keystroke 'y + c' copies uri of selected component to keyboard
- keystroke 'y + p' copies page uri to keyboard
- keystroke 'o + p' opens the page uri in a new tab
- keystroke 'o + c' opens selected component uri into a new tab (or page uri if no component selected)
